## Usage
Simply fill in the Albedo texture. If you have other textures, you can fill them in their respective fields to be used in the generation of the Mask Map.
If you need a normal map, enable the normal map generation.
Then simply run the mask map generation.
The files will be created in a new folder in the folder where the albedo was found.
